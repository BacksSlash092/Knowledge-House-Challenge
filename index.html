        <h3>Why should I be accepted? </h3>
        <p>I come from a family & culture of people who did not have the chance to make their dreams happen. Instead they concentrated on giving my generation a chance to make their dreams happen. My mother worked as a "cleaning lady" for as long as I can remember. She has always worked hard, and supported me. I want to seize the moment, and become a developer, so I can return the favor and help those who have helped and supported me. The reason I should be accepted to the this program, is that I will persever at any problem until it breaks. There is no challenge I'm not willing to take, and there is no knowledge I'm not open to learn. I'm looking forward to Join you guys on this Journey. </p>

            <blockquote>
            
            “As Aristotle wrote a long, long time ago, and I'm paraphrasing here, the goal is to avoid mediocrity by being prepared to try something and either failing miserably or triumphing grandly. Mediocrity is not about failing, and it's the opposite of doing. Mediocrity, in other words, is about not trying. The reason is achingly simple, and I know you've heard it a thousand times before: what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.”

            <h3>2016 - Snowden</h3><br>
            <p>Disillusioned with the intelligence community, top contractor Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) leaves his job at the National Security Agency. He now knows that a virtual mountain of data is being assembled to track all forms of digital communication -- not just from foreign governments and terrorist groups, but from ordinary Americans. When Snowden decides to leak this classified information, he becomes a traitor to some, a hero to others and a fugitive from the law.</p>
